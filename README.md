# Project overview
The aim of this project was to build, using Lego Mindstorm, a functioning AGV model which can be easily integrated with the production lines models (built with Lego as well) already presents in Manufactoring and Production Systems Unit laboratory of [Politecnico di Milano](https://www.polimi.it/).

We reached such objective through the realization of an autonomous chassis, able to follow a line drawn on the floor and coupled with specially crafted road markings. The chassis himself is able to cover the distance between two production lines, following the predisposed path and to maneuver in the proximity of the production line itself.<br>
This basic cart was later equipped with a hook, able to retrieve the product units from the lines and to put them in place on a different one.<br><br>
