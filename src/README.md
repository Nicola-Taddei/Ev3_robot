# Source code
The entire code, programmed following an OOP paradigm, is based on the class <code>Robot</code>, extended here by <code>AVG_polimi_lab</code> class, which implements, further than normal <code>Robot</code> functionalities, also a nipper function, through a <code>Nipper</code> class attribute object.

A simple demonstration can be run following the assembly instructions in the <code>docs</code> directory and running the <code>robot</code> module as a script: <br>
<code>$ python3 robot.py</code>
